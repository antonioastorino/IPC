# TCP - Transmission control protocol

From the main folder, compile using

```
make update            # generate Makefile
make                   # build
```

You need at least two terminal windows. From one of them, run the server:
```
./server-out-0
```
From the other(s), run

```
./client-out-0
```
and type the message you want to send to the server. Press `ENTER` to send the message. The server will respond by sending back the received message. The client terminates when the response is received.
